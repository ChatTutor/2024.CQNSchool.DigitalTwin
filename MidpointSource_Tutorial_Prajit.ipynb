    "## Brief Intro to Midpoint Source Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The midpoint source protocol is one of the canonical methods to generate entanglement between two distant parties. You have all delved into the details of the 'midpoint swap' or 'swap in the middle' protocol in the previous tutorials. The protocol was first suggested by Jones et. al [CITE]. It relies on access to three main components:\n",
    "1. A pair of quantum memories at the two distant parties that are wishing to generate entanglement. Let us call them Alice (A) and Bob (B).\n",
    "2. A source of entangled photons at the 'midpoint' that a third party Charlie (C) is handling.\n",
    "3. Quantum channels (i.e. mechanisms to send qubits) from C to A and B, as well classcial communication channels between all parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall protocol is quite simple. It proceeds as follows:\n",
    "1. C generates a pair of entangled photons and sends one to A and the other to B. They *also notify* A and B that they have done so.\n",
    "2. A and B receives the photons and store them in their quantum memories. If they have done so **successfully**, they communicate their success to each other.\n",
    "3. Once both A and B have signalled success, they are sure that their memories are entangled. They can now use these entangled memories to do any task that they need entanglement for (e.g. teleporting a quantum state, generating a shared secret key between them, etc.)\n",
    "4. If either A or B have signalled failure, they abort the protocol and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of the protocol is shown in the figure below. One might note that this is quite straightforward and does not require any fancy quantum operations. However, the devil is in the details. We shall see the various requirement for the protocol to work in the next section."

Furthermore, we require that the end parties A and B **know** when their share of the entangled photon pair is successfully stored in their memories. This is necessary for the protocol to work, as they need to communicate with each other to know when to proceed to the next step or whether to abort the protocol and restart.\n",

Examples of this memory have been proposed in the literature for as long as quantum information has been alive - and quite recently, experiments have been able to demonstrate them as well. We defer a detailed discussion of what these memories actually do to a later section. Curious readers can look at the following references for more details:\n",

    "The entanglement generation source is a device that is capable of generating entangled photons. This is the most important component of the protocol. Although generating entanglement might be trivial for some quantum systems, we specifically care about the generation of entangled photons. This is because photons are the most convenient carriers of quantum information over long distances, either via transmission on optical fibers (such as those that form the backbone of the Internet) or by free-space optical links (which is how satellites communicate with earth bound transmitter and each other). This task however is highly non-trivial and has been studied extensively. \n",

    "## Understanding the Construction of a Entanglement Generation Source\n",
    "Photonic entanglement generation sources rely on nonlinear interactions of a pump photon in a specific type of material, generally referred to as a nonlinear crystal. The pump photon is generally a high energy photon (i.e. a photon with a high frequency) that is converted into two lower energy photons (i.e. photons with lower frequencies). The process is generally referred to as 'spontaneous parametric downconversion' (SPDC). We usuially refer to the pump photon as the 'pump' and the two lower energy photons as the 'signal' and 'idler' photons. The process is shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The generated photons satisfy the energy conservation law, i.e. the sum of the frequencies of the generated photons is equal to the frequency of the pump photon. In addition, the net momentum of the generated photons is equal to the momentum of the pump photon. This is generally referred to as 'phase matching' and is a key requirement for the generation of entangled photons. We may succinctly write this as\n",
    "$$\\omega_p = \\omega_s + \\omega_i; \\quad \\vec{k}_p = \\vec{k}_s + \\vec{k}_i$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_p$ is the frequency of the pump photon, $\\omega_s$ and $\\omega_i$ are the frequencies of the signal and idler photons respectively, and $\\vec{k}_p$, $\\vec{k}_s$ and $\\vec{k}_i$ are the wavevectors of the pump, signal and idler photons respectively. The nonlinear process relies on differeing indices of refraction for the pump, signal and idler photons. The net range of frequencies that can be generated by the SPDC process is limited by the bandwidth of the nonlinear crystal, and is generally referred to as the **phase-matching bandwidth**. Alternate processes such as 'spontaneous four-wave mixing' (SFWM) can also be used to generate entangled photons; for this tutorial we shall focus on SPDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "To go from a single SPDC process, to a source of entangled polarization encoded photonic qubits, we must introduce some mechanism to erase path information of the photons. The general SPDC based polarization entaglement source consists of wo separate nonlinear crystals. By placing the crystals close to one another, we 'erase' information about which crystal the photon was generated in. Thus if the photon pair generated in the first crystal is in the state $\\ket{H}\\ket{V}$, then the photon pair generated in the second crystal is in the state $\\ket{V}\\ket{H}$. The relative polarization of the pump, signal and idler photons depend on the type of SPDC process that is used. For now let us only consider the simple case where we seek to generate entanglement of the form $\\ket{\\Psi^+} = (\\ket{H,V}+\\ket{V,H})/\\sqrt{2}$. \n",

The first pair of modes (Horizontal and Vertical 1 ) are cosnidered to be sent to Alice and the second pair of modes (Horizontal and Vertical 2) are considered to be sent to Bob. $N_s$ istypically called the mean-photon number per mode in the source - we shall work in the regime where $N_s\\lesssim 0.2$ to ensure that only terms upto $p(2)$ constibute to the state.\n",

Correspondingly $p(1)$ represents the probability of generating a single pair of photons in one of the modes and vacuum in the rest, and $p(2)$ represents the probability of generating two photons pairs in the modes and vacuum in the rest. The terms corrsponding to $p(1)$ are the useful terms as they signify the generation of entangled photons in the polarization basis. On the other hand, the terms corresponding to $p(2)$ are the 'noise' terms as the terms are not in the polarization qubit basis defined earlier.\n",

This always means that the proportion of 'vacuum' (no downconverted photons) will exceed both the single photon and two photon terms. This is a key limitation of SPDC based entanglement generation sources. The ratio of the single photon term to the vacuum term is typically referred to as the 'brightness' of the source. \n",

    "Furthermore, the terms corresponding to $p(2)$ contribute to noise. If the communication system was perfect and photons weren't lost then the user could tell apart between the cases where they received a single photon and two photons. However, in the presence of loss, this is not so simple. The two-pair terms after losing a photon cannot be discriminated from the single pair terms. This is a key limitation of SPDC based entanglement generation sources. We usually will optimize $N_s$ to maximize the brightness of the source while keeping the noise low. This can be evaluated by looking at the fidelity of the generated state with the ideal state $\\ket{\\Psi^+}$.\n",

We shall now look at a few strategies on how to build a source that seeks to alleviate some of the issues with SPDC based entanglement generation sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first idea would be to use single photons heralded by a detector. This is a very common strategy in quantum optics and is used in a variety of applications. The idea is to use a single photon detector to herald the presence of a single photon. This is done by placing the detector in one of the modes of the SPDC source. The detector is then used to herald the presence of a single photon in the other mode. A multitude of single photons generated in such a manner can then be used to generate entanglement by using a linear photonic circuit. Multiple proposals have been made to use this strategy to generate entangled photons. Readers may refer to the following references for more details:\n",
    "- [CITE]\n",
    "\n",
    "The second idea would be to use the existing SPDC based source and perform post-selection on the generated photons. Specifically, we need an auxilliary system that can herald the presence of the required Bell pair terms (i.e. $\\ket{1,0,0,1} + \\ket{0,1,1,0}$). The system must also be capable of reproducing the photonic states in the required Bell pair terms with a high probability. This is a non-trivial task that could be achieved by certain types of quantum memories or a some complicated measurement scheme. We shall not delve into the details of this scheme here except noting that this is quite complicated to achieve in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final idea would be to use a pair of existing SPDC  based sources and perform post-selection on the output photons by performing a joint measurement. As you may already be familiar, the Bell state projection measurement is a joint measurement on two qubits that projects them onto one of the four Bell states. This can be achieved with the linear optical circuits comprising of beamsplitters and detectors. A 'succesful' Bell state measurement, (ideally) projects the umeasured photons in the state $\\ket{\\Psi^+}$. Furthermore, since the measurement is heralded, we *know* when entanglement is generated. This is the basis of the 'cascaded heralded source' proposed in [CITE].\n",
    "\n",
    "The cascaded source shown in the figure above comprises of a pair of SPDC sources, each of which generates a pair of photons. The photons are then sent through a linear optical circuit that performs a Bell state measurement. The measurement is heralded by the detection of a pair of photons in a few specific modes. If the measurement is successful, then the photons are expected to be projected into the state $\\ket{\\Psi^+}$ - certainly this is so if the the SPDC sources generated Bell-pairs natively. If the measurement is not successful, then the photons are discarded. However, given the probabilistic nature of the SPDC sources, the output state must be computed from the entire state being conditioned  on the measurement being successful. We shall not delve into the details of this computation here, and refer the reader to the original paper for the details. However, we can write the form of the quantum state that is generated by the cascaded source as\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $m_1,m_2$ are dependent on the click patterns in the Bell state measurement. Paying close attention to the state, we have the necessary Bell pair terms that we need for the protocol and gotten rid of the vacuum and two-pair terms. However, we have introduced a new term $\\ket{0,0,1,1}+ (-1)^{m_1} \\ket{1,1,0,0}$ that is not in the polarization basis. However of a quantum communication protocol, this term is something that can be dealt with in the following fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that A and B receive the $\\ket{0,0,1,1}+ (-1)^{m_1} \\ket{1,1,0,0}$ term. If they measure their photons, they notice that  either (1) Alice signals the presence of a photon and Bob does not i.e. $\\ket{1,1,0,0}$, or (2) Bob signals the presence of a photon and Alice does not. In either case, they know that the other party has not received a photon. Thus they can simply discard the state and try again. This is a key feature of the 'undesired term' that gives the cascaded source its edge. Note that all of the above is true when we assume that Alice and Bob do not receive stray 'noise' photons from elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have hence shown that the cascaded source operates in a 'heralded' fashion to generate photonic states that are 'better' than the SPDC source. However, the price ot pay is that the overall probablity of generating a photon pair is worse. We not only need to consider that two terms in the SPDC source are both $\\ket{\\Psi^\\pm}$ which is propostional to $p(1)^2$ but also that the Bell state measurement is successful, which is an additional factor of $1/2$. Since for $N_s<0.2$, $p(1)\\ll 1$ it is no surpirse that the cascaded source is not very bright. However since the source is heralded, we can multiplex multiple sources together to generate entanglement at a higher rate. This is the basis of the 'multiplexed heralded source' proposed in extension to the original source design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure above, we consider $M$ such sources multiplexed together so that atleast one of them succeeds. Each source is conneected to a local controller that switches the successfully generated photon pairs out. If the the probability of generating a single pair is $p_{\\mathrm{single}}$, then the multiplexed source succeeds with probability $$p_{\\mathrm{multi}} (M) = 1-(1-p_{\\mathrm{single}})^M \\approx 1- (1- M\\times p_{\\mathrm{single}})= M\\times p_{\\mathrm{single}},$$\n",

    "A big challenge is that even with the best hardware and near perfect operation, $M$ turns out to be around $10000$! This is not practical for any real world implementation using spatially separate sources. One alternative is to consider a source that is integrated on a chip, where the multiplexing can be done on the chip itself. Alternatively, we can consider the use of frequency multiplexing to multiplex the sources together. This is the basis of the 'frequency multiplexed heralded source' also popularly called the 'zero added loss multiplexing' (ZALM) source proposed in [CITE]. We ignore the details of how frequency multiplexing is achieved in the ZALM source here, but the interested reader can refer to the original paper for more details. For all practical purposes, we can consider the ZALM source to generate the state $\\ket{S}$ with high probability with additional information about the frequency of the output photons.\n",
