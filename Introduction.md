The course aims to provide training for quantum network simulation and modeling, emphasizing starting from first principles to model elementary quantum links for realistic deployed quantum networks. Essential topics in quantum information and quantum optics will also be surveyed. We will be using the QuREBB package for a part of the course, and using some bespoke code for the other part.
